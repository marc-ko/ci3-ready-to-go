# Codeigniter 3 Ready To Go System   
---
Since every time building up the whole framework from scratch takes a bit of time 
So I decided to build this ready-to-go system to start every project as soon as possible 
---

* This ready-to-go project should be including
- [X] Login & User Role (Codeigniter3 Authenticator)
- [X] Backend with working UI
  - [X] Dashboard
  - [ ] Settings
    - [ ] Turning on/off features
    - [ ] Content Editor of Frontend
  - [ ] Adding a new user (for admin)
- [ ] Frontend with working UI
  - [ ] Working Element (can access the content)
  - [X] Login page
- [ ] Working API 
- [ ] Documentation (Knowledge base)
  - [X] API Documentation
